## Project: BloppiDate (Encapsulation and abstraction)



### Exercise 3
Let's change the internal storage of BloppiDate to be a number of days since 0/0/0
instead of day, month, year.

Does this make `diffDays` and `addDays` easier?

How about `toString` and the constructor?

Do all your tests still pass?


## Project: Bloppians (Inheritance)

*Bloppian inheritance*
- A Bloppian can fly, talk and eat
- However, a female Bloppain can also lay eggs and fly twice as fast as male Bloppian
- A male Bloppain shouts when it talks and can also fertilize eggs

### Task 1: Implement FemaleBloppian and MaleBloppian classes
- Ensure all unit tests pass
