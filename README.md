## Project: BloppiDate (Encapsulation and abstraction)



### Exercise 3
Let's change the internal storage of BloppiDate to be a number of days since 0/0/0
instead of day, month, year.

Does this make `diffDays` and `addDays` easier?

How about `toString` and the constructor?

Do all your tests still pass?
